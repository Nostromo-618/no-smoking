# Auto GitHub Pages Deployment

This project includes an automated deployment system that builds your Vue.js app and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch for GitHub Pages hosting.

## üöÄ Automated Deploy

**Step 1:** Build the project
```bash
npm run build
```

**Step 2:** Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run deploy:pages
```

The deployment script will:
1. **Switch** to gh-pages branch
2. **Clean** the gh-pages branch (keeping only built files)
3. **Deploy** the dist folder contents to gh-pages root
4. **Add** `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing
5. **Commit & Push** to GitHub
6. **Switch back** to main branch

## üéØ All-in-One (Alternative)

If you prefer a single command:
```bash
npm run build && npm run deploy:pages
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **main branch**: Source code (Vue.js + TypeScript + Vite)
- **gh-pages branch**: Built files only (HTML, CSS, JS, assets)
- **dist folder**: Temporary build output

## üåê Live Site

Your site is available at: https://nostromo-618.github.io/no-smoking/
